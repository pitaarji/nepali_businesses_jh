        <p>Jackson Heights in Queens, New York City is home to one of the largest concentrations of Nepali-owned businesses in North America. Over two-dozen Nepali restaurants, shops, law offices, accountants, and other businesses are located within a three-block radius of the 74th Street and Roosevelt Avenue intersection.</p>

        <p>For Nepalis all over New York City, Jackson Heights serves as a hub for shopping, services, and eating.</p>
